## <img src="static/icons/dw.json.png" alt='File icons' width="16"/> Ukraine

Hi, I'm Serhii and I'm from Ukraine. Today every aspect of Ukrainians' lives suffers from russia's brutal unreasonable invasion and ongoing war. Despite that, we all do our best to hold up and share nice things with good people around. Including this extension.

There are many ways you can support Ukraine and therefore me. The most impactful is donations. Chose whatever you prefer and if you're not sure check <https://savelife.in.ua/en/>.

Let this be a good deed of a day! Thanks!
